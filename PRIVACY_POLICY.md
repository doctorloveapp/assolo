# Assolo Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 2025**

## Overview

Assolo ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Information We Do NOT Collect

Assolo is designed with privacy in mind. We do **not** collect, store, or transmit:

- Personal identification information
- Location data
- Usage analytics or telemetry
- Audio recordings or files
- Contact information
- Device identifiers

### Local Data Only

All data used by Assolo remains on your device:

- **Audio Files**: When you load backing tracks, they are processed locally and never uploaded to any server
- **Settings**: Your preferences (key selection, wave type, volume) are stored locally on your device
- **No Cloud Sync**: We do not use cloud services to sync or backup your data

## Permissions

Assolo requests the following Android permissions:

| Permission | Purpose | Required |
|------------|---------|----------|
| `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` (Android 13+) | Load audio files for backing tracks | Optional |
| `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` (Android 12 and below) | Load audio files for backing tracks | Optional |

**Note**: These permissions are only requested when you choose to load an audio file. The app functions fully without them.

## Third-Party Services

Assolo does **not** integrate with any third-party services that collect user data, including:

- No advertising SDKs
- No analytics platforms
- No crash reporting services
- No social media integrations
